# How to Push to GitHub

Since the environment doesn't have GitHub CLI or SSH keys set up, you'll need to push manually. Here are your options:

## Option 1: Using Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. Create a personal access token on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it repo permissions
   - Copy the token

2. Push using the token:
   ```bash
   git push https://[YOUR_TOKEN]@github.com/jezweb/kubuntu-default-setup.git main
   ```

## Option 2: Using GitHub CLI

1. Install GitHub CLI (if not already):
   ```bash
   ./scripts/dev-tools/02-github-cli.sh
   ```

2. Authenticate:
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```

3. Push:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Option 3: Set up SSH

1. Generate SSH key:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "jeremy@jezweb.net"
   ```

2. Add to GitHub:
   - Copy: `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
   - Add at: https://github.com/settings/keys

3. Change remote to SSH:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jezweb/kubuntu-default-setup.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
